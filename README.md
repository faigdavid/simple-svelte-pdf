# simple-svelte-pdf

A svelte component that can render PDF files using pdfjs. Comes with zoom, print, and download buttons.

Since the PDFjs official documentation doesn't really bridge the gap from the examples to the demo viewer, I decided to make something in-between for hobbiests like me to work with.

Feel free to take the code apart and use it however you like!
