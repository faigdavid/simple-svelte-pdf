# simple-svelte-pdf

A svelte component that can render PDF files using pdfjs. Comes with zoom, print, and download buttons.

Since the PDFjs official documentation doesn't really bridge the gap from the examples to the demo viewer, I decided to make something in-between for hobbiests like me to work with.

Feel free to take the code apart and use it however you like!

## Demo

To see a simple demo of the pdf component, build and run from the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/faigdavid/svelte-pdf-scrollable

cd svelte-pdf-scrollable

npm install

npm run dev
```

From there you should be able to see it at `http://localhost:5173/`
